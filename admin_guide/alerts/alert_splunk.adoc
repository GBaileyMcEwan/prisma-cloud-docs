== Splunk Alerts

Splunk is a software platform to search, analyze, and visualize machine-generated data gathered from websites, applications, sensors, and devices.
Prismaâ„¢ Cloud integrates with Splunk and monitors your assets and sends alerts for resource misconfigurations, compliance violations, network security risks, and anomalous user activities to Splunk.
Prisma Cloud continually scans your environment for vulnerabilities, Complience, Runtime behavior, WAAS valiolations and more. You can monitor your Prisma Cloud alerts in Splunk using a native integration.

=== Sending alerts to Splunk

==== Set up Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) to view alert notifications from Prisma Cloud in Splunk.

Splunk HEC lets you send data and application events to a Splunk deployment over the HTTP and Secure HTTP (HTTPS) protocols. This helps consolidate alert notifications from Prisma Cloud in to Splunk so that your operations team can review and take action on the alerts.

[.procedure]
. To set up HEC, use instructions in https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector[Splunk documentation].

. In *Credential*, create the credentials required to access the account.

For example, if you have an image with the following labels:

  group=front-end-group
  team=client-team
  business-app=my-business-app

You could configure Prisma Cloud to open issues about this specific image in the JIRA project defined by the _group_ label.
