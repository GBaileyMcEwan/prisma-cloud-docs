== Splunk Alerts

Splunk is a software platform to search, analyze, and visualize machine-generated data gathered from websites, applications, sensors, and devices.

Prismaâ„¢ Cloud integrates with Splunk and monitors your assets and sends alerts for resource misconfigurations, compliance violations, network security risks, and anomalous user activities to Splunk.
Prisma Cloud continually scans your environment for vulnerabilities, Complience, Runtime behavior, WAAS valiolations and more. You can monitor your Prisma Cloud alerts in Splunk using a native integration.

=== Sending alerts to Splunk

Follow the instructions below to send alerts from your Prisma Cloud Console to Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud Platform.

==== Set up Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) to view alert notifications from Prisma Cloud in Splunk

Splunk HEC lets you send data and application events to a Splunk deployment over the HTTP and Secure HTTP (HTTPS) protocols. This helps consolidate alert notifications from Prisma Cloud in to Splunk so that your operations team can review and take action on the alerts.

[.procedure]
. To set up HEC, use instructions in https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector[Splunk documentation].
note that the defult *source type* is *_json* 

. Select *Settings > Data inputs > HTTP Event* Collector and make sure you see HEC added in the list and that the status shows that it is *Enabled*.

==== Set up the Splunk integration in Prisma Cloud Enterprise

[.procedure]
. Log in to Prisma Cloud Console

. Go to *Manage > Alerts > Manage*

. Click on *+ Add profile* to create a dedicated alert profile for Splunk

.. Enter a name for your alert profile

.. In *Provider*, select *Splunk*

... In *Splunk HTTP event collector URL*, enter the Enter the Splunk HEC URL that you set up earlier.

... In Custom JSON, enter the structure of the JSON payload, or use the defult JSON. 
For more details about the type of data in each field, click *Show macros*.

... Enter *Auth Token*
The integration uses token-based authentication between Prisma Cloud and Splunk to authenticate connections to Splunk HEC. A token is a 32-bit number that is presented in Splunk.

.. In *Alert triggers* section, select the triggers that you would like Splunk to be alerted by

.. Click *Send test alert* to test the connection. You can check in Splunk to see the test

==== Set up the Splunk integration in Prisma Cloud SAAS

Prisma Cloud Compute in SAAS uses the same notification settings set up in the platform for CSPM alerts. These configurations are setup in the platform under *Settings > Integrations*, and can be used in Compute by importing them as an Alert Profile. Any changes to the provider settings will need to be done on the platform side.

[.procedure]

. https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/configure-external-integrations-on-prisma-cloud/integrate-prisma-cloud-with-splunk.html[Integrate Prisma Cloud with Splunk]

. Importing platform configurations inside Compute:

.. Navigate to *Manage > Alerts > Manage* tab in Compute, click on "Add Profile"

.. From the Provider drop down, select *Prisma Cloud*

.. In the Integrations field, select the configuration you set up with Splunk in step 1 

.. Select triggers to be sent to this channel

.. Click Save

=== Message structure

Both integrations with Splunk, via Prisma Cloud SAAS and Enterprise eddition, generates the same event format. 

==== JSON schema

The JSON scema includes the following defult fields:
[.procedure]
. app: Prisma Cloud Compute Alert Notification
. message: contains the alert content in a JSON format as defined in the *Custom JSON* field
