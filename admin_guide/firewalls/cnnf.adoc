== Cloud Native Network Firewall (CNNF)

Cloud Native Network Firewall (CNNF) is a Layer 4 network monitoring tool.
CNNF automatically learns how your microservices communicate, and shows the communication mesh on Radar.

=== Architecture

Defender monitors how your containers and hosts connect to each other in real-time.

Defender inspects connections before they're set up.
After a connection is established, traffic flows directly between source and destination without any further oversight from Defender.

Defender adds iptables rules to observe TCP's three-way handshake.
The three-way handshake sets up new connections using SYN messages.
For each pod or container IP address, Defender adds an iptables rule with the target set to NFQUEUE.
NFQUEUE is an iptables target which delegates the decision of how to handle a packet to a userspace program (in this case Defender).
When SYN messages arrive, Defender evaluates them to track connections.
From this vantage point, Defender can see all connections.

The following screenshot shows the mesh Radar draws for a typical microservices app.
Radar draws directed edges for each connection, and displays the associated port number.
An instance count for each node shows how many copies of the image are running as containers.
Black bubbles mean the runtime model is in enforcement mode.
Blue bubbles mean the runtime model is in learning mode.

=== Network objects

You might have resources that interact with external, non-containerized services.
For example, the payment gateway might pass information to an external service to verify transactions.

Network objects represent sources and destinations.
Network objects can represent container images, subnets, and hosts.
In this case, you can create a new network object representing a range of IP addresses or, in this example, a single IP:

When the network object is saved, Radar shows both the learned and manually defined rules:

To create a network object, go to *Defend > Firewalls > Cloud Native Network Firewall*, click *Add Network Object*, and specify an IP address or subnet.

=== Enabling CNNF

CNNF runs in one of two modes: Disabled or Enabled.

Disabled::
CNNF displays limited traffic flow data on Radar, including outbound connections to the Internet and connections local to the node iteself.
By default, CNNF ships in the disabled state.

Enabled::
CNNF monitors all connections, including connections across hosts and connections to any configured network objects.

[.procedure]
. Open Console.

. Go to *Defend > Firewalls > Cloud Native Network Firewall*.

. Enable CNNF for hosts and containers.
