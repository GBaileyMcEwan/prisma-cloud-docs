== Add an AWS Organization to Prisma Cloud

+++<draft-comment>AWS Org : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nlSAgqNH0-QgnfPpstZG7bOPeClNkPr0la0ciTR_tl8/edit?ts=5f3d3e8c#https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LaM4NiIf1FG_LznHBhl98WyY2PtRcSAh/view</draft-comment>+++

If you have consolidated access to AWS services and resources across your company within AWS Organizations, you can onboard the AWS _master account_ on Prisma Cloud. When you enable AWS Organizations on the AWS management console and add the root or _master_ account that has the role of a payer account that is responsible for paying all charges accrued by the accounts in its organization, all member accounts within the hierarchy are added in one streamlined operation on Prisma Cloud.

image::aws-org-structure.png[scale=30]

In this workflow, you first deploy a CloudFormation template in the master account to create the Prisma Cloud role to monitor, or monitor and protect your resources deployed on the master account. And then, you use CloudFormation StackSets to automate the creation of the Prisma Cloud role, which authorizes Prisma Cloud to access each member account. When you then add a new member account to your AWS organization, it is onboarded automatically on Prisma Cloud within a few (up to six) hours.

[NOTE]
====
* If you want to exclude one or more Organizational Units (OUs) and all the member accounts it includes, you can manually disable individual member accounts on Prisma Cloud after they are onboarded. Alternatively, to onboard a subset of accounts, you can exclude the OUs when deploying the StackSet so that the Prisma Cloud role is only created in the OUs for which you want to onboard accounts.

* If you had previously onboarded your AWS master account as a standalone or individual account, you must re-add the account as an Organization. All your existing data on assets monitored, alerts generated, or account groups created are left unchanged.
+
After you onboard your account as an AWS Organization, you cannot roll back. To add the account as a standalone or individual account, you must delete the Organization on Prisma Cloud and use the instructions to xref:add-aws-cloud-account-to-prisma-cloud.adoc#id8cd84221-0914-4a29-a7db-cc4d64312e56[Add an AWS Cloud Account on Prisma Cloud].

* If you had previously onboarded an AWS account that is a member of the AWS Organization that you now add on Prisma Cloud, all your existing data on assets monitored, alerts generated, or account groups created are left unchanged. On Prisma Cloud, the member account will be logically grouped under the AWS Organization.When you delete the AWS Organization on Prisma Cloud, you can recover all the existing data related to these accounts if you re-onboarded within 24 hours. After 24 hours, the data is deleted from Prisma Cloud.

. Select the *Mode*.
+
Decide whether to enable permissions to only monitor (read-only access) or to monitor and protect (read-write access) the resources in your cloud account. Your selection determines which AWS Cloud Formation Template (CFT) is used to automate the process of creating the custom role required for Prisma Cloud.

+
To automate the process of creating the Prisma Cloud role that is trusted and has the permissions required to retrieve data on your AWS deployment, Prisma Cloud uses a CFT. The CFT enables the ingestion of configuration data and AWS CloudTrail logs (audit events) only, and it does not support the ability to enable VPC flow logs for your AWS account or any other integrations, such as Amazon GuardDuty or AWS Inspector.
+++<draft-comment>If you do not want to use the CFT to create the role, see xref:set-up-your-prisma-cloud-role-for-aws-manual.adoc#ide7b46e67-8e1f-400f-b763-48bbe41bbe2c[Set Up the Prisma Cloud Role for AWS—Manual] for instructions on creating the role and attaching the policies manually.</draft-comment>+++

+
.. Paste the *Member Role Name* and *Member External ID* into Prisma Cloud.

.. Select *I confirm the stackset has created Prisma roles in member accounts successfully* and click *Next*.
+
If you have a large number of member accounts, it may take a while to create the role in each account and list it for verification. If you want to verify that the role was created in all accounts, do not select the checkbox. You can edit the cloud account settings later and onboard the member accounts. If you do not select the checkbox, only the master account will be onboarded to Prisma Cloud.
