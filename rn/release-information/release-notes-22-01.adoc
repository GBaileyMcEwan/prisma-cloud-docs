=== New features in the core platform

In addition to familiarizing yourself with the new features and enhancements in this release, review the minimum  https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/22-01/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/install/system_requirements.html[System Requirements] for versions that are tested and supported on 22.01. 

==== Enhanced scoping options for vulnerability tags

// #26291

* Vulnerability tags are predefined labels that can help you manage the vulnerabilities in your environment. With this enhancement, Prisma Cloud allows you to granularly tag vulnerabilities based on CVE ID, package, and resources. 
* Using a new management page for tags and their assignments, you will be able to assign a tag to a CVE for a single package, or for all the packages affected by it. You will also be able to assign a tag to a specific resource (e.g. ubuntu:18.04), multiple resources, resources defined using wildcards (e.g. ubuntu:*), or to all the resources across your environment. 
* For container images, you will be able to assign the tag to a base image, and Prisma Cloud will automatically assign it to all its descendant images.

==== Organization-level credentials for GCP

// #25992

* Adds support for organization-level credentials for GCP. Organization-level credentials let Prisma Cloud find and scan all the projects in the organization. 
* Use organization-level credentials on various features such as cloud discovery and registry scanning, to simplify Prisma Cloud credentials management, and eliminate the need for creating credentials per project.

==== Log DNS queries in Forensics

// #30406

* Extends the forensics capabilities with recording DNS queries in forensics for Containers, Hosts, and App-embedded Defenders.

==== Cortex XDR integration

// #28960

* Adds support for sending alerts to Cortex XDR. With this integration, Cortex XDR is now a native alert provider to which Prisma Cloud Compute can send runtime audits and incidents.

==== Simplified Console-Defender communication certificates management process 

// #29347

* Enhances the certificate management process for Console-Defender communication. 
   ** The rotation of the Console-Defender communication certificates is now automatically done by Prisma Cloud Compute one year before expiration. 
   ** During the year after rotation and until expiration of the old certificates, the Console is able to communicate with Defenders with both old and new certificates side-by-side. 
   ** All the Defenders must be redeployed during this year to acquire the new certificate. UI indications are provided to ensure you know which Defenders require redeployment.
   ** New Defenders deployed after the rotation will be getting the new certificate.
* Updates certificate management to alert users about Console CA certificate expiration 90 days in advance, rather than 30 days.

==== One more new feature


=== New features in container security

==== Kubernetes auditing for EKS and AKS 

* Kubernetes auditing is now supported also for AWS EKS clusters as well as Azure AKS clusters 
* The settings configuraton was enhanced and now allows add kubernetes auditing setting records for each of cloud providers  
* >>>Screenshot

==== Kubernetes auditing cluster filter  

* Kubernetes auditing policy rules now allows to configure the rules using a cluster filter
* This allows cusotmers to granuluazlie their rules to the relevant specific clusters while the ingestions can be done for a wider range of clusters   
* >>>Screenshot

==== CIS benchamrks extended support   

* The list of supported CIS benchamrks was extended to cover:
   ** CIS openshift v1.1.0 support 
   ** Updated support for latest CIS Docker bencmark 1.3.1 
   ** Updated support for latest CIS Kuberntes 1.20 (CIS v1.1.) 
* >>>Screenshot

==== Compliance for containerd containers  

* All CRI runtime compliance checks are now applicable also for containerd containers 
* >>>Screenshot

==== Alerts integration with Splunk

* You can now send alerts from Prisma Cloud Compute edition Console to Splunk. 
     ** This helps consolidate alert notifications from Prisma Cloud into Splunk so that your operations team can review and take action on the alerts.
     ** This is in addition to the existing Prisma Cloud Enterprise edition integration with Splunk.
     ** The Alert integration with Splunk is done via the Splunk HTTP Event Collector, using the _json source type.

==== Protecting Runtime events from PII/sensitive information:

* Prisma Cloud Compute Runtime events may include sensitive information that's found in commands run inside protected workloads. Now you can filter this sensitive information and ensure that it is not included in the Runtime findings (including Forensics, Incidents, audits, etc.).
     ** PII sanitization is important for protecting user privacy as well as ensuring that logs comply with relevant regulations (PCI, GDPR, HIPAA, amongst others).
     ** There are two options to scrub your sensitive Runtime data in Prisma Cloud Compute:
          *** Default scrubbing configuration: automatically scrub secrets from runtime events. This configuration will be *enabled* by default when upgrading the Console.
          *** Customize your own regex to detect and scrub sensitive information, in addition to the existing capabilities in WAAS.
     ** Head to Manage > General to see the options that are now available.
    
==== Immediate vulnerability alerts

* You can now choose to send alerts immediately when new vulnerabilities are detected, in addition to the existing vulnerability alerting mechanism. 
* Immediate alerts can be sent in one of the following scenarios:
     ** Deploying a new image/host with vulnerabilities
     ** Detecting new vulnerabilities when re-scanning an existing image/host
     
==== Defend your containers running on AKS Windows containerd nodes

* Extend the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) to support containers running on Windows nodes with containerd runtime:

     ** You can now install the Prisma Cloud Windows container defender on your AKS Windows containerd nodes.
     ** By installing the Defender you will be able to view the running containers and images on the Radar and leverage Prisma Cloud Runtime Defense capabilities on the running containers.
     ** Vulnerabilities and Compliance scanning are not supported yet

==== Improve performance of Harbor registry scanning

* Enhanced the Harbor Registry scanning performance

==== Extend RBAC capabilities cross Prisma Cloud views

* Extend RBAC capabilities cross Prisma Cloud views to limit data only to specify users and groups based on the Resource List and Collections assignments.
* These enhancements will affect the restricted views after the first scan.

==== Deploy defenders on VMware Tanzu Isolation Segment

// #29370

* Adds support for deploying Defenders on VMWare Tanzu TAS isolation segments (Network and Compute Isolation).

==== Scan remote VMware Tanzu blobstores 

// #25722

* Adds support for scanning remote VMWare Tanzu TAS blobstores, located in a different cloud controller than the scanning Defender.
