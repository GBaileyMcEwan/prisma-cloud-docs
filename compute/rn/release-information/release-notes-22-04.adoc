[#_cve-coverage-update]
=== CVE coverage update

As part of the 22.04 release, Prisma Cloud has rolled out updates to its vulnerability data stream for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).
Need to ask Ariel and Sharon's team for any updates here. Keeping it the placeholder for now.

====Rule to Allow Actvity in Attached Sessions

// #32874 ( this is marked as a core feature, but I have added it in the container security section because the changes are for containers)

When you start a session inside pods or containers running in your deployment using commands such as kubectl exec or docker exec, you can now explicitly specify whether the rule should allow the activity in attached sessions. This option helps you reduce the volume of alerts generated for the allowed activities and processes.

When enabled, process, network and filesystem activity executed in an attached session such as kubectl exec, is explicitly allowed without additional runtime analysis.

Only Defender versions 22.05 or later will support this capability.
