== App-Embedded Defender for Fargate

App-Embedded Defenders for Fargate monitor your tasks to ensure they execute as designed, protecting tasks from suspicious processes and outbound network connections.

App-Embedded Defender policies let you define:

* Process allow or deny lists.
Enables verification of launched processes against policy.

* Outgoing connections allow or deny lists.
Enables verification of domain name resolution against policy for outgoing network connections.

Besides runtime policy, you can also configure the xref:../../waas/waas.adoc[WAAS] application firewall to protect front-end Fargate tasks.


=== Architecture

When you embed the App-Embedded Defender into your Fargate task, Prisma Cloud modifies the task definition.
The updated task definition includes a Prisma Cloud sidecar container.
The sidecar container handles all communication with Console, including retrieving policies and sending audits.
It also hosts the App-Embedded Defender binaries, which are shared with the task's other containers through a shared volume.
The embed process modifies each containerDefinition to:

* Mount the Prisma Cloud sidecar container's shared volume to gain access to the App-Embedded Defender binaries.
* Start the original entrypoint command under the control of App-Embedded Defender.

App-Embedded Defenders do not communicate directly with Console.
All communication is proxied through the Prisma Cloud sidecar container.
The following diagram illustrates the setup:

==== WAAS for Fargate

All the capabilities of standard WAAS are available for Fargate tasks.
The only difference is that Fargate Defenders run as a reverse proxies to all other containers in the task.
As such, when you set up WAAS for Fargate, you must specify the exposed external port where Fargate Defender can listen, and the port (not exposed to the Internet) where your web application listens.
WAAS for Fargate forwards the filtered traffic to your application port - _unless an attack is detected and you chose_ *Prevent* _in your WAAS for Fargate rule_.

For more information on the type of attacks that Prisma Cloud detects and prevents, see xref:../../waas/waas.adoc[Prisma Cloud WAAS].


==== Securing Fargate tasks

To secure a Fargate task, embed the Prisma Cloud Fargate Defender into it.
The steps are:

. Define your policy in Prisma Cloud Console.
By default, there are no rules in the App-Embedded runtime policy.
App-Embedded Defenders dynamically retrieve policies from Console as they are updated.
You can embed the App-Embedded Defender into a task with very simple initial policies, then refine them later as needed.

. Embed the Fargate Defender into your task definition.

. Start the service.

When securing Fargate tasks with runtime rules and WAAS, target rules to tasks using the *Scope* fields.
For runtime, scope rules by image and container name.
Policy is applied per-container in the task.

image::install_app_embedded_defender_fargate_runtime_rule_scope.png[width=500]

For WAAS, scope rules by App ID.
Policy is applied per-task.
The WAAS firewall listens on a specific port, and since all containers run in the same network namespace, it applies to the entire task.

=== Embedding App-Embedded Defender into Fargate tasks

Prisma Cloud cleanly separates the code developers produce from the Fargate containers we protect.
Developers don't need to change their code to accomodate Prisma Cloud.
They don't need to load any special libraries, add any files, or change any manifests.
When a container is ready to be deployed to test or production, run your task definition through our transform tool to automatically embed the Fargate Defender, then load the new task definition into AWS.

The method for embedding the Fargate Defender was designed to seamlessly integrate into the CI/CD pipeline.
You can call the Prisma Cloud API to embed the Fargate Defender into your task definition.

*Prerequisites:*

* The task where you’re embedding the App-Embedded Defender can reach Console’s port 8084 over the network.
* You have a task definition.
* You have already created an ECS cluster.
* Cluster VPC and subnets.
* Task role.
* Your image have shell.

IMPORTANT: Your task definition must include matching `entrypoint` and `cmd` parameters from the Dockerfile(s) of the image(s) in your task.
Because Prisma Cloud does not see the actual images as part of the embedding flow, we depend on having these parameters present to reliably insert the App-Embedded Defender into the task startup flow.
If your Dockerfile doesn't specify an `entrypoint` parameter, you must specify a default one, such as `/bin/sh`, in the task definition.
Because the `cmd` parameter is optional, if your Dockerfile doesn't specify a `cmd` parameter, one isn't required in the task definition.

[NOTE]
====
You can optionally run the Fargate Defender sidecar as a non-essential container.
This configuration isn't recommended because Defender's goal is to ensure that tasks are always protected.

If you've configured Defender as a non-essential container and you're having issues with your setup, first validate that Defender is running as expected before contacting Palo Alto Networks customer support.
By setting Defender as non-essential, there is no guarantee that Defender is running, and validating that it's running is the first step in debugging such issues.

=== Support task definition formats

Prisma Cloud supports the following task definition formats:

* Standard JSON format, as described https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html[here].
* CloudFormation templates for `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition` in JSON format only, as described https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ecs-taskdefinition.html[here].

*Example of a standard JSON format task definition:*

----
{
    "containerDefinitions": [
        {
            "name": "web",
            "image": "nginx",
            "entryPoint": [
                "/http_server"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "cpu": "256",
    "executionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole",
    "family": "webserver",
    "memory": "512",
    "networkMode": "awsvpc",
    "requiresCompatibilities": [
        "FARGATE"
    ]
}
----

*Example of the equivalent task definition as a CloudFormation template:*

----
{
  "Type" : "AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition",
  "Properties": {
      "ContainerDefinitions": [
        {
          "Name": "web",
          "Image": "nginx",
          "EntryPoint": [
              "/http_server"
          ]
        }
      ],
      "Cpu" : 256,
      "ExecutionRoleArn": "arn:aws:iam::112233445566:role/ecsTaskExecutionRole",
      "Family": "webserver",
      "Memory" : 512,
      "NetworkMode" : "awsvpc",
      "RequiresCompatibilities" : [
          "FARGATE"
      ]
    }
}
----

[NOTE]
====
The CloudFormation template above shows the minimum fields required by Prisma Cloud to process the template and embed a Defender.
AWS requires additional fields to process the template, including `Resources` and `taskdefinition`, as fallows:

// See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ecs-taskdefinition.html#aws-resource-ecs-taskdefinition--examples

----
{
  "Resources": {
    "taskdefinition": {
      "Type" : "AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition",
      "Properties": {
      .

[.task]
=== Embed App-Embedded Defender from the Console UI

You can created a protected task definition in the Console UI.

*Prerequisites:*

* You've already created an ECS cluster, cluster VPC, and subnets.
* You've already created a task role.
* You have a task definition.
* At runtime, your tasks can connnect to Prisma Cloud Console over the network.
Prisma Cloud Defender connects to Console to retrieve runtime policies and send audits.
For Enterprise Edition, Defender talks to Console on port 443.
For Compute Edition, Defender talks to Console on port 8084 (although the port number is configurable at install-time).

[.procedure]
. Log into Prisma Cloud Console.

. Go to *Manage > Defenders > Deploy > Defenders*.

. Select *Single Defender*.

. In the first drop-down list, choose the name or IP address App-Embedded Defender should use to connect to Console.
+
NOTE: A list of IP addresses and hostnames are pre-populated in the drop-down list.
If none of the items are valid, select the *Names* tab and add a new subject alternative name (SAN) using *Add SAN* button.
After adding a SAN, your IP address or hostname will be available in the drop-down list in the *Deploy* tab.
+
NOTE: Selecting an IP address in a evaluation setup is acceptable, but using a DNS name is more resilient.
If you select Console's IP address, and Console's IP address changes, your Defenders will no longer be able to communicate with Console.

. In the *Defender Type* drop-down list, choose *Container Defender - App-Embedded*.

. Set the *Deployment type* to *Fargate task*.

. Embed the Fargate Defender into your task definition.

.. Set *Template type* according to the format used to specify your task definition.
+
* *Native Fargate* -- Standard JSON format, as described https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task_definition_parameters.html[here].
* *CloudFormation* -- CloudFormation template for `AWS::ECS::TaskDefinition`, as described https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ecs-taskdefinition.html[here].

.. Copy and paste your task definition into the left-hand box.

.. Click *Generate protected task*.

.. Copy the updated task definition from the right-hand box.


[.task]
=== Embed App-Embedded Defender with twistcli

The twistcli command line tool lets you embed App-Embedded Defender into Fargate task definitions.

*Prerequisites:*

* You've already created an ECS cluster, cluster VPC, and subnets.
* You've already created a task role.
* You have a task definition.
* Running tasks can connnect to Prisma Cloud Console over the network.
Prisma Cloud Defender connects to Console to retrieve runtime policies and send audits.
For Enterprise Edition, Defender talks to Console on port 443.
For Compute Edition, Defender talks to Console on port 8084 (although the port number is configurable at install-time).

[.procedure]
. Log into Prisma Cloud Console.

. Go to *Manage > System > Utilities*, and download twistcli for your machine's operating system.

. Run twistcli to embed Defender into the task definition.
+
----
$ twistcli app-embedded generate-fargate-task \
  --user <USER> \
  --address "<CONSOLE_URL>" \
  --console-host "<CONSOLE_ADDR>" \
  --output-file "protected_taskdef.json" \
  taskdef.json
----
+
If your task definition file is specified as a CloudFormation template, then add the `--cloud-formation` option to the twistcli command.
+
* `<USER>` -- Prisma Cloud user with a role of Defender Manager or higher.
* `<CONSOLE_URL>` -- https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1808.html#section-2.1[RFC 1808 scheme and netloc] for Console.
twistcli uses this value to connect to Console to submit the task definition for embedding Defender.
Example: +https://127.0.0.1:8083+
* `<CONSOLE_ADDR>` -- https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1738#section-3.1[RFC 1738 host] where Console runs.
This value will be the fully qualified domain name of the network host, or IP address, where Console runs.
This value configures how the embedded Defender connects to Console.

=== Jenkins Fargate example

Passing the Fargate task definition to your Prisma Cloud Console's API returns the Prisma Cloud protected Fargate task definition.
Use this task definition to start Prisma Cloud protected Fargate containers.
This example demonstrates using the Jenkins Pipeline build process to:

* Call the Prisma Cloud Console's API endpoint for Fargate task creation.
* Pass the Fargate task definition to the API.
* Capture the returned Prisma Cloud protected Fargate task definition.
* Save the Prisma Cloud protected Fargate task definition within the Pipeline's archive \https://<jenkins>/job/<pipeline_name>/<job#>/artifact/tw_fargate.json

In this example, a simple task _fargate.json_ and _Jenkinsfile_ have been placed in a GitHub repository.
