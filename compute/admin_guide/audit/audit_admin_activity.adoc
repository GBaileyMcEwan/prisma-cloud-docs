== Administrative activity audit trail

All Prisma Cloud administrative activities are logged.

Changes to any settings (including previous and new values), changes to any rules (create, modify, or delete), and all logon activity (success and failure) are logged.
For every event, both the user name and source IP are captured.

Audit records for App-Embedded runtime audits, Trust audits, Container network firewall audits, and Host network firewall audits are retained for up to 25,000 entries or 50 MB, whichever limit is met first.

For login activity, the following events are captured:

* Every login attempt from the login page, including failures.
* Every failed attempt to authenticate to the API.
Successfully authenticated calls to the API are not recorded.

The full set of log data is available to anyone with a xref:../authentication/user_roles.adoc[user role] of auditor or higher.

To view the administrative history, open Console, then go to *Manage > Logs > History*.

Settings and rule events show how a configuration has changed.
Both the API endpoint, and a diff of the previous and current JSON objects are shown.
The following screenshot shows the changes to a vulnerability rule:

Use the https://prisma.pan.dev/api/cloud/cwpp/policies/[API reference] to determine what has changed and how to interpret the meaning of the change.
The `/api/v1/policies/cve` endpoint creates and modifies vulnerability rules.
An `id` of `46` specifies how to handle vulnerabilities in OS packages.
And `minSeverity` specifies the threshold for taking the action specified in `block`.
In this case, user `ian` has changed the threshold for blocking containers with vulnerable OS packages from `9` (Critical) to `7` (High).
