== API definition scan

Prisma Cloud scans the API definition files and generates a report for any errors or shortcomings.

The API definition scan allows you to view a detailed report either by importing the API definition file, or using the previously imported API definition file.
The list shows the source of the API definition file.

The following screenshot shows the API definition scan files:

You can also filter the API definition files by using the scan date, import source, or file name.

=== Report details

To view, open the report from the *Actions* column for each API definition file.

The following screenshot shows the issues table that lists the issues belonging to different categories and the level of severity:
