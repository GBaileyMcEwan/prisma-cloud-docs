== Deploy WAAS Out-Of-Band for Containers

Create a new rule to deploy WAAS xref:../waas-intro.adoc#_waasoob[Out-Of-Band] for Containers.

=== Prerequisites

* You have xref:../../install/defender_types.adoc#[installed a Container Defender] in your workload environment.
* The minimum version of Console and Defender is 22.12. 
* A TLS certificate in PEM format.

=== Create a WAAS rule for Out-Of-Band network traffic

To deploy WAAS for Out-Of-Band network traffic, create a new rule, define application endpoints, and select protections.

[.procedure]
. Open Console, and go to *Defend > WAAS > Container > Out-of-Band*.

. Click *Add rule*.

. Enter a *Rule Name* and *Notes* (Optional) for describing the rule.

. Choose the rule *Scope* by specifying the resource collection(s) to which it applies.
+
image::waas_select_scope.png[scale=20]
+
Collections define a combination of image names and one or more elements to which WAAS should attach itself to inspect the web application:
+
image::waas_define_collection.png[scale=20]
+
NOTE: Applying a rule to all images using a wild card (`*`) is invalid - instead, only specify your web application images.

. (Optional) Enable *API endpoint discovery*
+
When enabled, the Defender inspects the API traffic to and from the protected API.
Defender reports a list of the endpoints and their resource path in *Compute > Monitor > WAAS > API discovery*.

. (Optional) Enable *Automatically detect ports* for an endpoint to deploy the WAAS's protection on ports identified in the unprotected web apps report in *Monitor > WAAS > Unprotected web apps* for each of the workloads in the rule scope.
+
NOTE: As an additional measure, you can specify additional ports by specifying them in the protected HTTP endpoints within each app to also include the ports that may not have been detected automatically.
+
NOTE: By enabling both *Automatically detect ports* and *API endpoint discovery*, you can monitor your API endpoints and ports without having to add an application and without configuring any policies. 

. *Save* the rule.

=== Add an App (policy) to the rule

[#actions]
=== WAAS Actions for Out-Of-Band traffic

The following actions are applicable for the HTTP requests or responses related to the *Out-Of-Band traffic*:

* *Alert* - An audit is generated for visibility.

* *Disable* - The WAAS action is disabled.

=== Troubleshooting

*No inspection generated by WAAS Out-Of-Band for TLS protocol*

Ensure that the requests use a supported TLS protocol and cipher suite, and respect the limitations listed in the Limitations section.
