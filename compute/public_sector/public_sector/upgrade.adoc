== Upgrade Process for deployments in isolated environments

Some deployments of Prisma Cloud Compute are only provided the updated container images.
The supported and documented https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/21-08/prisma-cloud-compute-edition-admin/upgrade/upgrade_process_self_hosted.html[upgrade process] requires the generation of new Console Deployment and Defender daemonSet yamls.
The tools to perform the required upgrade tasks are posted xref:../isolated_upgrades/isolated_upgrades.adoc[here.]
